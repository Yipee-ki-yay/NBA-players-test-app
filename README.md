## Getting Started

In order to start a project we need to do the following steps:

1. In the project root folder we need to open a terminal and run "yarn" or "npm install".
2. The api.balldontlie uses API_KEY, so we need to create a .env file in the root folder. You could rename .env_example to .env and paste the API_KEY to it:
	REACT_APP_API_KEY="key"
3. To start a project locally run "yarn start" or "npm start" and open localhost:3000.
